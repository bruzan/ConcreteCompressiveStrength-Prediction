# Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction

This project objective is trying to predict the compressive strength of concrete given it's ingredients and age. 3 different models where utilized and compared: linear, lasso and ridge regression.

Compressive strength is the resistance of a material or structure to rupture under compressive forces. The compressive strength of concrete determines its performance during its service condition, making its study extremely important.

The characteristics of concrete depend on the types of ingredients used and their proportions. The main constituents of concrete are cement, water and aggregates in varying proportions, but some other materials can also be included in the mix to obtain the required strength and properties.

The dataset contains 9 variables:

1. Cement(kg/m^3): A binder, a chemical substance used in construction that fixes, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is rarely used alone, but rather to bond sand and aggregate.

2. Water(kg/m^3): The amount of water in concrete controls many properties, including: workability, compressive strength, permeability and tightness, durability and weathering, drying shrinkage, potential for cracking.

3. Fly Ash(kg/m^3): Fly ash is a fine powder that is a by-product of burning pulverized coal in electric power generation plants. This residue is created when mineral impurities in coal melt as they leave the combustion chamber.

4. Superplasticizer(kg/m^3): Superplasticizers are additives to concrete that are added to reduce the water content in a mix while maintaining flow properties.

5. Blast Furnace Slag(kg/m^3): Slag is formed in a blast furnace with molten iron from iron ore in the reducing presence of heated air, coke and limestone. The resulting molten slag and iron, once removed from the furnace, is subject to further processing to form crystalline aggregate or ground blast furnace slag.

6. Coarse Aggregate(kg/m^3): Coarse aggregates are any particles greater than 0.19 inch, but generally range between 3/8 and 1.5 inches in diameter. Gravels constitute the majority of coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone making up most of the remainder.

7. Fine Aggregate(kg/m^3): Fine aggregates are essentially any natural sand particles won from the land through the mining process. Fine aggregates consist of natural sand or any crushed stone particles that are ¼” or smaller.

8. Age(days): The compressive strength of concrete increases with age, due to the cement hydration process that takes place over time.

9. Concrete Compressive Strength(MPa): The compression strength of concrete is a measure of the concrete's ability to resist loads which tend to compress it. It is measured by crushing cylindrical concrete specimens in compression testing machine.
